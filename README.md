## Documentation Delivery Pipeline

As a Lead Technical Writer, I harness the power of agile methodologies and sprints to ensure that documentation evolves hand in hand with product development. Here's how I make it happen:

### Agile Documentation Approach

- **Documentation Backlog:** I maintain an ever-evolving documentation backlog that includes user stories, improvements, and updates. This backlog is continuously refined based on user feedback and shifting project priorities.

- **Sprint Grooming:** Before each sprint, a grooming call ensures that the backlog is prioritized and ready for the technical writer team to plan their sprint. Documentation tasks are prioritized based on their impact on user experience, ensuring that the documentation pipeline remains aligned with the product's evolution.

- **Sprint Planning:** The Sprint planning involves story point estimation. Each documentation ticket is discussed for any queries or clarification between the team, lead, and product manager.

- **Sprint Duration:** My documentation sprints are carefully aligned with development sprints. This synchronization ensures that documentation is ready to roll out in harmony with new features or updates.

- **Job Stories:** Just as developers craft user stories for features, I create job stories tailored for documentation. This ensures that each piece of content directly addresses user needs and pain points.

- **Collaboration:** I collaborate closely with development teams, product managers, and designers to gather insights and remain informed about upcoming changes. This collaboration guarantees the accuracy and timeliness of the documentation.

- **Incremental Updates:** With each sprint, I focus on delivering documentation that enhances user experience. This could involve introducing new guides, refining existing content, or providing valuable troubleshooting resources.

- **Review and Iteration:** At the conclusion of each sprint, I engage stakeholders in a thorough documentation review and gather their feedback. This process guarantees the documentation is accurate, clear, and aligned with user needs.

- **Deploy Previews and Release:** Every pull request has a deploy preview generated so that the document can be visualized. Once the PR is approved and merged, the changes are updated on the published site.
