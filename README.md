### 📃 About me

I'm a staff technical writer with a developer's mindset—bringing **19+ years of experience** across software engineering, developer education, and documentation strategy.

My current focus: **AI-native documentation systems** that scale with engineering teams and support emerging workflows like **semantic search, RAG, and LLM fine-tuning**. I build docs like software—modular, maintainable, and automation-friendly.

### 🧠 Core expertise

- **AI-native documentation systems**: Designing for LLM integration, embedding context, and long-term content intelligence  
- **Docs-as-Code workflows**: Git-based documentation, CI/CD pipelines, Markdown-first tooling  
- **Developer and API docs**: Clear integration guides, REST API references, real-world code samples  
- **Infra & platform documentation**: PaaS, SaaS, and cloud-native architecture docs (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes)  
- **Tooling & tech stack**: Docusaurus, GitBook, Markdown, Mermaid, OpenAPI/Swagger, Vale, GitHub Actions  
- **Content systems at scale**: Modular structures, versioning, search optimization, and internal content reuse
